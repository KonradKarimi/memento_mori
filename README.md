# Memento Mori
This app is a result of my recent thoughts about life and death. Every day we spent time given to us on our birth.

>“It's like we die a little every day.”

Stop and think for a moment. Ask yourself a question. **Do you spend your precocious time on things and people that are most valuable to you?**

Be aware that time is the only asset given to you it cannot be recharged nor renewed. You won't get a second chance. Be mindful of your decisions. Enjoy your life!

Because `Why not? 🙃`

*As a side note, I wanted to test myself and try to develop this app using flutter in under one day.* 😎

## More technical

I’ve heard somewhere in the data science community maxima saying that:
> **You have to always visualize your data!**

So I’ve plotted a graph. Each data point (square) is one week. So in a year, we have 52 weeks. And yes, here comes the tough question. How many years do we have?! Les’s assume by default that we have 80 years to live.

Filled square is a week that you’ve already lived. Not filled ones are still available for you to live.

Square --> week

Row (52 Squares) --> year

## Usage
Provide the date of your birth to the app. If you want you can also change your life expectancy (default 80 years). Click save and check out what has been plotted!

## Roadmap
- [ ] Deploy Android version to google play
- [ ] Prepare installer for other platforms

## P.S.
That's weird that we all met at this time and place. Just think you’ve could be born anytime since life on Earth started. Anyhow you’re here reading this app description.

This app helps me with procrastination. I was writing this at the airport waiting for my delayed flight.
